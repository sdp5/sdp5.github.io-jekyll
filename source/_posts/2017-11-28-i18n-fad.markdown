This time [Pune, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune) was selected for [Fedora Activity Day](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_I18N_2017) 2017 of Internationalization (i18n) Engineering. Folks from all over APAC and EMEA joined together to exchange ideas, fix long pending bugs and hack on new ideas. Thanks to [Bex](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bex) for approving budget and moving i18n FAD arrangements further! [Jens](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Petersen), [Parag](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pnemade) and [Pravin](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pravins) played vital roles in organising everything required to make it happen.

`Akira Tagoh` started the session with highlights on fonts development. He discussed some really interesting topics like fontconfig cache, flatpack support and font-tweak-tool. `Peng Wu` took over to catch up on Pango development plans: Unicode 10 support and bidirectional algorithm.
