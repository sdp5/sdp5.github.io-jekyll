It has been long attending some talks - specially around **Python**!! And PythonPune looks perfect to meet some folks working with Python in the happening city - PUNE. If I remember correctly it was 6:30 I woke up and dropped text to my friend at Baner - *planning to spend latter half of the day at your place* - as venue was at GSLabs, Baner. 

### Opening

Chandan Kumar greeted everyone there and with some backgrounds/purpose of this meetup called for a round of introduction - *we had the strength of 50* - with some new faces. Nevertheless common goal was to **learn new things**. Akshay Goel started the talks with his discussions around `pyautogui` - an awesome module to automate keyboard/mouse events.

### My Talk

And then came my turn. Again [Zanata-Python-Client](https://speakerdeck.com/sundeep/zanata-python-client) but with more insights to why localization, what purpose Zanata solves and how to start contributing to python-client project. This includes [walk-through](https://youtu.be/LpyDF6u6DN8) of interacting with Zanata using python-client. I think everyone enjoyed slides/demo. Got a few questions as well.

### Remainder

This was followed by Narayan Behara, who demo'd working of `Boto3 python library for AWS`. And Kiran Yallabandi presented his experiences on `decorators` - this was a deep dive. With some more topics the meetup concluded in an informative one, and I guess - everyone enjoyed sharing thoughts with morning tea/coffee.

With hope to meet all in the next meetup, I headed friend's place - and had a great time there as well - indeed :)
